    `Welcome to Madam Herta’s — a cozy little restaurant drifting somewhere between the stars and the kitchens of the Trailblazer’s journey. Here, every dish — from humble snacks to hearty meals — is prepared with the same care and finesse that Madam Herta herself would demand. Our cooks — the mini Hertas — bustle about the kitchen, juggling pans, spices, and a dash of cosmic dust, always striving to serve warmth, comfort, and delight to every hungry customer who walks in.`,
    `Under the watchful sponsorship of Asta, our restaurant aims to bring together travellers and locals alike — a place where friendships are forged over shared meals, and stories are swapped under the soft hum of the dining lights. We envision a space where the fascinating worlds of Honkai: Star Rail converge with the welcoming vibe of a neighborhood eatery: familiar yet extraordinary.`,
    `Our menu is inspired by the consumables from Honkai: Star Rail — transformed, of course, to real-world edible dishes. Each plate and drink carries a whisper of spacefaring adventure, an echo of energy-boosting meals and buff-inducing treats you’d find in the game, yet with flavors and comforts grounded in reality.`,
    `Come sit, relax, and enjoy — whether you’re a hard-working traveller, a crew member seeking respite, or just someone looking for a good meal and good company.`,
    `Madam Herta is a peerless gem. Madam Herta is an unrivaled genius. Madam Herta is an inimitable beauty.`
